    <h3>ABOUT</h3>
    <p>Katsu curry is just a variation of Japanese curry with a chicken cutlet on top. I have used a store-bought block of Japanese curry roux which is commonly used in Japanese households. Chicken Cutlet (Japanese version of chicken schnitzel) brings the Japanese curry up to the next level. It’s so delicious and filling.</p>

    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <h4>Curry</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>400 grams onion sliced into 1cm wide pieces</li>
      <li>250 grams potatos cut into 1.5cm cubes</li>
      <li>100 grams carrots sliced into 7mm thick pieces</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
      <li>1/2 packet of 230 grams House Vermont Curry</li>
      <li>800ml water</li>
      <li>4 cups cooked rice</li>
      <li>4 chicken cutlets cut into 2.5cm wide strips</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <h4>Preparation</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Add oil into a pot and heat over medium high heat.</li>
      <li>Add onion and sauté for a few minutes or until the onion becomes translucent and edges start getting slightly burnt.</li>
      <li>Add potatoes and carrots into the pot and stir for a couple of minutes or until the surface of the vegetables starts getting cooked.</li>
      <li>Add water and turn the heat up to bring it to a boil. Then reduce the heat to medium low and simmer for about 7 minutes or until the vegetables are nearly cooked through.</li>
      <li>Break the curry roux cake into small blocks along the lines and add them into the pot. Stir gently to blend the curry roux.</li>
      <li>Place a lid on and cook over low heat for about 10 minutes or until the curry roux is completely dissolved. Stir occasionally.</li>
      <li>Check the consistency of the sauce. It should be like béchamel sauce. If too thick, adjust with some water. If too thin, cook further without the lid. It will thicken when cooled down as well.</li>
      <li>Turn the heat off.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Serving</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Place a cup of hot cooked rice onto one side of a plate. Place the chicken cutlet pieces next to the rice, leaning them on the rice so that there will be a space to pour the curry.</li>
      <li>Pour curry next to the chicken cutlet and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>ENJOY :)</h3>
