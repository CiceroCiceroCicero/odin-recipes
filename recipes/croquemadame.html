    <h3>ABOUT</h3>
    <p>Literally meaning "mister crunch," the croque monsieur is a treasure trove of textures; pop a fried egg on top of your sandwich to transform it into a croque madame. This sandwich stars layers of thinly sliced ham, soft, melty cheese, and an audible crunch as you bite down on the toasted bread. Hidden in plain sight is a traditional Mornay sauce: a béchamel sauce that's been upgraded with melted Gruyère. If you're not a fan of the pungent flavors of Gruyère, feel free to opt for milder Comté.</p> 
    <p>This sandwich is a lot to handle, so pick a nice, sturdy thick piece of bread to hold everything together!</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350°. Make Mornay sauce: In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. Add flour and stir until fragrant, 1 minute. Gradually whisk in milk and add salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Bring to a simmer, whisking constantly, and cook until sauce thickens, 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in Gruyère. Let cool 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Assemble Croque Monsieurs: In a large ovenproof skillet over medium heat, toast bread on both sides until lightly golden. Spread half tablespoon butter on each slice, then flip over two slices and spread each with 1 teaspoon mustard and 1 tablespoon Mornay sauce. Top each mustard slice with 3 slices ham, ¼ cup Gruyère, and remaining bread slices. Evenly spread tops of each sandwich with 2 tablespoons sauce, and sprinkle with remaining Gruyère.</li>
      <li>Transfer skillet to oven and cook until cheese is melty and top is golden, 15 to 18 minutes.</li>
      <li>In a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, melt butter. Crack eggs into skillet and fry until whites are set, 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and top each sandwich with an egg.</li>
